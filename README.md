# Reasonml/OCaml glossary

Greetings, wanderer. Reason and OCaml ecosystem are now growing extremely fast and may want to go aboard this train. But if you're coming from another ecosystem, say .NET of Java or Js, you may find this esy, dune, bucklescript, jsoo and whole bunch of other stuff pretty confusing. So I dared to cobble up a glossary of terms and tools for you to be in the context.

## Tools

* [**Bucklescript**](https://bucklescript.github.io/) - build system to build javascript from Reason/OCaml. It's simple, you can install it from npm and it produces kinda readable output. Considered as modern way to use Reason stack for frontend development.
* [**JSOO - Js of OCaml**](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml) - not old but more earlier version of OCaml->Js transpiler. Focuses more on producing perfomant code. Read [Bucklescript to JSOO comparison](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/comparison-to-jsoo)
* [**Esy**](https://esy.sh/) - package manager for native Reason/OCaml that looks like yarn and works with `package.json`
* [**Dune**](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) - build system for native Reason/OCaml
* [**Refmt**](https://github.com/polydawn/refmt) - ?
* [**Merlin**](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin) - library for editor support
